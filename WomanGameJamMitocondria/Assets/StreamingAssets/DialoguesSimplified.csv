1;1;A comission? At this hour?...
1;2;Good Grief
1;3;Skrimbles' fur is so soft...
1;4;My mom gifted this to me when I was a kid...
1;5;A good energizer before returning to work
1;6;Cool, refreshing water!
1;7;Take a deep breath
1;8;A good face wash soothes me a little
1;9;A shower never hurts to clear your head
1;10;One more little chapter and then back to work
1;11;A little appetizer
1;12;Hope you're happy!
